# SUMDU Bug Tracker

SUMDU Bug Tracker is a bug-tracking system for Sumy State University which developed by Vladyslav Babych and Kyrylo Balatsenko.

This project is a parseltongue (Harry Potter fans can understand it, hehe) renovation of existed SSU Bug Tracker which developed by Vlad Honcharenko and Yevhenii Pysmennyi.

## How it works?


1. Just make a photo of problem, send it to our telegram bot with location and description.
2. Administrator will get messages with problems and if university can solve it, he will accept your request.
3. All bugs will be shown rector or vice-rectors and they delegate to needed department to solve it.

It's easy, isn't it? ☺️
